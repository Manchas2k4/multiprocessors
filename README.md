# Multiprocessors (TE3061)
This is an advanced theoretical course in computer equipment programming which provides students with knowledge about the functioning of computer systems based on multi-core microprocessors and architectures of multiple interconnected microprocessors. It requires previous knowledge in operating systems and computer equipment interfaces. Learning outcome: students will design and program algorithms using the paradigm of task fragmentation in order to solve problems using multi-core computer systems and/or systems with multiple processors.
